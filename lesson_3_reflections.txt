When would you want to create a remote repository rather keeping all your work local?

	If you want to collaborate on a project, creating a remote repository where multiple
	developers have access to the same repository is beneficial. That is, different members
	of the team can add features and push the data to the remote and others could see and
	pull the updated data to their local repositories so they could continue working on 
	the project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automaticallly 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes the updated commit that is proposed by one of the users needs to be discussed 
	by all the parties involves to ensure that it runs all on devices and they all have a
	concensus that this is the production code. 

	In that case, manually pullung data makes more sense that automatically staying sync
	with a version that is not the productin code.
