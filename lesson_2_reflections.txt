What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, a hidden git directory is created on the same directory as your files, where you can make commits and keep a track of changes in your files.
	We need to do it since the system does not automatically create a repository for version control.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 

	Staging area is the area in between the working directory and the repository.
	So first we add the files we want to commit, and then by creating a commit,
	git adds the files in the staging area into the repository as a commit.
